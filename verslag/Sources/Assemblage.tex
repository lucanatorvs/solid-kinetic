Het mechanisch ontwerp van de printer was al vastgesteld, de printer hoefde dus
alleen nog in elkaar woorden gezet. De printer is gebaseerd op de Ender-5, een
robuuste printer die een goed platform bied om een ge√Øsoleerde behuizing  er
omheen te bouwen. De printer is voorzien van dubbele laser gesnelde wanden met
glas wol daar tussen. Ondank dat de assemblage van de behuizing niet in de
scoop van het project valt, was het wal nodig om verder te gaan met het
project. dus dat was als eerste gedaan.
